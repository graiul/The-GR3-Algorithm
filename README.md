Abstract:
The purpose of the research presented in this paper is finding the best execution times for searching subgraph isomorphisms. For this was created the GR3 Algorithm, its design consisting of a combination of Parallel Programming and Quantum Computing. The obtained execution times are significantly small. Thus can be deduced that an approach such as this is superior in obtaining the required results. The original contribution consists in studying a Parallel Programming approach combined with Quantum Computing Circuits and Groverâ€™s Algorithm for searching subgraph isomorphisms using a laptop and real quantum computers [16].
